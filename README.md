OpenGamma tools for R
---------------------
This repository contains the R integration project.

This repository contains the code for the OpenGamma R library. We will soon be
merging this code into the main OG-Platform repository containing all of our
other open source components, at which point this repository will be deleted.

This package is dependent on the OG-Language component from the main
OG-Platform build. If these artifacts are not correctly generated then no
artifacts will be produced from here.

To run the package, the integration service from OG-Language will require a
running engine instance to connect to (e.g. run the server from OG-Examples
and use opengamma.engine.host=localhost in tests.properties).

Assuming that OG-Language builds correctly then the R package should compile
and run from Linux as long as R is in the path and R-devel headers are in the
standard include path.

It is not currently possible to build the R package from a Windows environment
without configuring R to work with Microsoft Visual Studio. We will soon be
posting instructions on how to do this, but will be publishing MSI files as
part of the 1.0 release for those unable to perform a source build.
